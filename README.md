# wezterm-config

My wezterm config based off of my current workflow on a MacOS machine.

It includes a standard configuration for fonts, window/tab management, and background opacity.

Instructions:
1. Download or clone the repository. You will only be needing the .lua file.
2. Depending on the Operating system, rename and paste it on the directory where the wezterm application will be loading this configuration.
